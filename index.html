        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. Currently, I am studying Pre-Business, however, I plan to eventually go specifically into Business Marketing. My plan after college is to start off in a marketing firm and gain more skills. From there, my goal is to work my way up to and work for a corporation. At UCR, I am in the Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority in which we value friendship, leadership, and scholarship. Our philanthropy, Reading Is Fundamental, helps us promote literacy in children, especially in less fortunate areas. This past year, I was given the rewarding opportunity to participate in this philanthropy where I volunteered to read books to kids at their school. Many kids do not have the opportunities that we are privileged enough to receive so this philanthropy is very important to me. I am very thankful to have been able to help promote literacy as well as give these kids a fun day at school that they could enjoy. This was a great experience as I was able to see their faces light up and know how much our service means to them. <br><br>

        In addition, I was a barista at a small coffee shop called Cafe Roule. I worked there for about a year and have learned many valuable lessons during my time. As a barista, I made and served drinks as well as food. I worked alone so I was able to improve my time management as well as maximize my time between taking orders, serving, and providing customer service. It also gave me countless hours of one to one interactions with the consumers in which I have learned the value of customer service skills and communication. Throughout my time here, I was trusted with a great deal of responsibility from my employers which made me realize that I was to be consistent with my work and work ethic. This experience allowed me to have a fundamental understanding of being independent as well as being depended upon and I value the skills I was able to learn that will benefit me throughout my career.<br><br>

        Furthermore, I have been in a nonprofit organization called Helping Hands in which we volunteer for multiple organizations in and around our community. We dedicated our time to help places such as Wings, a shelter for battered women and children, the Humane Society, an animal shelter, as well as multiple beach cleanups. We volunteered with Wings and the Humane Society to help raise and donate money to their shelters as we believed in their cause and wanted to help in any way that we could. We also went to multiple beaches to help with beach cleanups where we picked up plastic and other trash to lessen the litter and pollution that could potentially lead to the ocean and harm the animals. By volunteering, I learned so much about my community and what it means to give back and I am grateful to have been given these opportunities.
